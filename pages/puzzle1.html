			<p> If you feel stuck, maybe download the image of the clue</p>
			<!--One other thing, you may want to use what you get from this puzzle to find a hidden page, by adding a .html at the end-->
			<p>
				For Extra help, read this:<br>
				<ul>
					<li>After downloading the image, look for a word hidden in the picture</li>
					<li>Once you have found the word, have a look again at the filename of the image you just downloaded.</li>
					<li>Take a look at the Vigenere Table and try to put 2 and 2 together to solve the puzzle!</li>
					<li>To "submit" your final answer, go to the address bar of your browser,
						and at the end of the website URL add another '/' and add your answer with a .html at the end <br><br>

						Example:<br>
						Format: https://www.test.com[/{puzzle_name}.html]<br>
						Answer: https://www.test.com/hiddenpage.html<br>
